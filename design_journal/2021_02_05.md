# Design Choices

## Separate Repository

I created a separate repository for my Oracle GoldenGate study because I
expect this to a standalone project.

## Simple Inventory

I decided to create a simple inventory without any groups. I do not see any
need for groups at this stage.

## No Configuration of AutoFS Clients

I assume that AutoFS has been configured elsewhere.

## Installation Procedure

I am following the installation procedure described in
"[Installing Oracle GoldenGate 19.1](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/goldengate/core/19.1/installing/index.html)"
because that is the official Oracle documentation.

# Outstanding Issues

Need to edit the OGG response file template, `templates/oggcore.rsp.j2`.
