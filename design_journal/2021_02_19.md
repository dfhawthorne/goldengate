The reference was
"[Configuring Oracle GoldenGate in a Multitenant Container Database](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/goldengate/core/19.1/oracle-db/configuring-oracle-goldengate-multitenant-container-database-1.html#GUID-0B0CEB35-51C6-4319-BEE1-FA208FF4DE05)"

## Other Requirements for Multitenant Container Databases

"[Other Requirements for Multitenant Container Databases](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/goldengate/core/19.1/oracle-db/configuring-oracle-goldengate-multitenant-container-database-1.html#GUID-2E63BBF9-2EE1-424B-9492-77501AFEC2F1)"
says:

> Extract must connect to the root container (`cdb$root`) as a common user in
> order to interact with the logmining server. To specify the root container,
> use the appropriate SQL*Net connect string for the database user that you
> specify with the `USERID` or `USERIDALIAS` parameter.

### FLUSH SEQUENCE for Multitenant Database

> `FLUSH SEQUENCE` must be issued at the PDB level, so the user will need to
> create an Oracle GoldenGate user in each PDB that they wish to do sequence
> replication for, and then use `DBLOGIN` to log into that PDB, and then perform
> the `FLUSH SEQUENCE` command.

This means I will have to create a PDB OGG user as well.

## Variable Names

The variable, `client_name`, was split into two (2) within the host variable
files:

1. `client_cdb_name` OGG user in the CDB
1. `client_pdb_name` OGG user in the PDB
