# 2021-02-16: Create Oracle DB Configuration Script

## Overview

Some design decisions for the creation of the configuration script.

# Table of Contents

* [Script Name](#script-name)
* [Other Host Variables](#other-host-variables)

# Script Name

The script name is chosen to be `configure_oracle_gg.py`. This name is meant to
distinguish by database engine.

The script name is defined in host variables file because the type of database
engine determines the script name.

# Other Host Variables

Other host variables are:

| Host Variable         | Description                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | 
| `local_service_name`  | Service name to be created in PDB |
| `remote_service_name` | Service name of the remote PDB    |
| `remote_host_name`    | Host name where the remote PDB is |
| `client_type`         | Type of OGG client: "CAPTURE" or "APPLY" |
| `client_name`         | User name of OGG administrator    |
