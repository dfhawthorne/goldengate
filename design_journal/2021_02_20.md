I made some changes to the DBA services prior to configuring Oracle
GoldenGate (OGG).

## Prerequisites for Configuring Integrated Capture 

"[Prerequisites for Configuring Integrated Capture](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/goldengate/core/19.1/oracle-db/configuring-extract.html#GUID-BE14166D-9552-4A75-B249-7DA9FEF8AA0F)"

## Host Variables

Since I need to configure OGG in both the CDB and PDB, I need to define four (4)
TNS aliases - two (2) local and two (2) remote.

I removed the following two (2) host variables:

- `local_service_name`
- `remote_service_name`

And I added the following four (4) host variables:

- `local_cdb_service_name`
- `local_pdb_service_name`
- `remote_cdb_service_name`
- `remote_pdb_service_name`
